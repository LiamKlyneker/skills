# prove-branch

**Prove the branch from the branch.** A developer opens a fresh session on a branch whose
implementation is finished and runs `/qa:prove-branch` with **no argument**. Everything the pass
needs — the ticket, the pull request, the preview deployment it runs against, the acceptance
criteria it proves — is found from the checked-out branch and the project adapter. Where the branch
does not say exactly one thing, the skill **stops and asks**; it never guesses.

**It is an external tester.** It writes nothing into the project under test: no test ids, no spec
files, no fixtures, no configuration, no feature-flag overrides committed anywhere, no app code. The
project is the same after a run as before it. What a run produces lives on the tracker, never in
the tree.

**It runs on user invocation only.** Neither `work-on-prd` nor `work-on-spec` invokes it, and
nothing else may: ADR 0012 keeps every QA pass on demand, and ADR 0020 applies that to this
plugin.

**A fresh session.** The pass judges the branch as built, so it starts from the branch and the
tracker, never from the conversation that wrote the code.

## Project facts

Every project-specific value comes from the **project adapter** at
`<repo-root>/.claude/project/adapter.md` — read it; never hardcode one here. This skill reads five
sections and nothing else:

| Adapter section | What for |
|---|---|
| `## Repo` | the `Tracker:` line (absent means `github`), which decides the resolver keys and where the run's pull request lives; the optional `Ticket source:` line, which decides where the ticket is read and what key 4 looks for; the default branch; the tracker sub-section's locators — on `github` the *Issue tracker / PRs* row, on `azure-devops` the *Organisation*, *Work-item project*, *Repo project*, *Repository* and *Title prefixes* rows |
| `## Commands` | the read-only and verify commands the skill may run without asking |
| `## Verify ladder` | what a sub-step must name to be executable, and what the skill can verify without a human |
| `## QA` | the rows below, by name |
| `## Sources of truth` | the **project explorer agent** for on-demand elaboration — `Explore` where it says None |

From `## QA`, by row name:

| Row | What for |
|---|---|
| *Session method* | how a flow signs in — `api` against the endpoint written after the value, or `manual` |
| *Credential environment variables* | per role, the **names** of the variables holding its username and password. Read them from the backticked tokens: roles are unquoted labels separated by ` · `, each followed by `→` and two backticked variable names, and everything after the em dash is guidance. The skill reads only names here and **never reads a credential value from the adapter** |
| *State catalog* | the named states a flow may `start from:`, the ids that identify each, and how to reach it |
| *Preview URL pattern* | how the pull request's preview deployment URL is formed, or `pr-comment` — read in `## The target` |
| *Feature-flag override* | how one session turns a flag on or off, or `none` |
| *Browser automation consent* | `yes` records that the skill may drive a real browser against the preview |

A missing `## QA` section is not a stop at this point: `## The target` stops when it needs the
*Preview URL pattern* row and finds none.

`[PRD]`, `[SPEC]` and `[FINDINGS]` below are shorthand for the adapter's *Title prefixes* row. On
`azure-devops` the prefix is load-bearing, so read it from the row; if the row names different
prefixes, they win.

On `azure-devops` the work-item and pull-request reads go through the Azure DevOps MCP server
(`mcp__ado__*`). Tool and parameter names vary by server version; where a named tool or field is
missing, discover the equivalent from the running server and announce the substitution. A read that
cannot be performed at all is a stop, never a silent omission.

## Resolving the run

The run is two things: the **ticket** whose criteria the pass proves, and the **pull request** the
preview deployment belongs to. Both are found from the branch.

### First, read the branch

Three reads, all read-only, before any key is tried:

- the branch: `git branch --show-current`. An empty result is a detached `HEAD` — stop, say so.
- the commit subjects on the branch: `git log <default-branch>..HEAD --format='%s'`, with
  `<default-branch>` from `## Repo`.
- the **open pull requests whose head is this branch**:
  - `github`: `gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state open --head <branch> --json number,headRefName,headRefOid,title,body,url`
  - `azure-devops`: `mcp__ado__repo_pull_request` listing active pull requests whose source branch
    is `refs/heads/<branch>`, against the **repo project** and **repository** — never the
    work-item project.

None of these is a stop on its own result. A branch with no pull request still runs the keys, so
the stop that follows can say everything the branch did and did not carry.

### Four keys, in order

Try the keys in this order. **The first key that yields exactly one hit wins**, and no later key is
tried. A hit is one distinct ticket: three commits carrying the same `(#12)` are one hit, and two
commits carrying `(#12)` and `(#13)` are two.

1. **`PRD: #<n>` in the pull request's body** — `github` only. A whole line of the open pull
   request's body, the machine block's resume key that `work-on-prd` writes:

   ```bash
   gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state open --head <branch> --json number,body \
     --jq '.[] | {number, prd: [.body | split("\n")[] | select(test("^PRD: #[0-9]+[ \t\r]*$")) | capture("#(?<n>[0-9]+)").n]}'
   ```

   **Match the whole line, never a substring** — `PRD: #12` is a prefix of `PRD: #127`, and a
   substring match hands you somebody else's run. The hit is the PRD `#<n>`, and the pull request
   is the one whose body carried it.

2. **The `[SPEC]`'s `ArtifactLink` to the pull request** — `azure-devops` only. For the open pull
   request on this branch, read its linked work items, and fetch each with `mcp__ado__wit_work_item`
   (`action: "get"`), `expand: "relations"` and **no** `fields` filter — the two are mutually
   exclusive, and a filter suppresses relations. Keep a work item when its title carries the
   `[SPEC]` prefix **and** its relations carry an **`ArtifactLink`** named `Pull Request` whose url
   is a `vstfs:///Git/PullRequestId/…` artifact id with **the pull-request id as its last segment**.
   `work-on-spec` puts that link on the `[SPEC]` when it opens the pull request, so the link is the
   `[SPEC]`'s own statement of which run is its. The hit is that `[SPEC]`.

3. **A `(#N)` suffix on the branch's commit subjects** — every tracker. A subject ending in `(#N)`
   is a commit for ticket `N`; the orchestrators and `work-on-task` write it as the last characters
   of the subject. The hit is ticket `N`.

4. **The ticket-source key** — every tracker. The ticket key that `../_shared/ticket-source.md` §3
   names for the system the adapter's `Ticket source:` line selects, or the `Tracker:` line where
   there is no `Ticket source:` line, found in the commit subjects and in the open pull request's
   body: for `jira`, an issue key in the form §2 accepts (`ABC-123`); for `azure-devops`, an
   `AB#<id>` work-item mention. For `github` the key is the issue number, which is key 3's shape —
   a bare number found in free text is not a ticket key, so this key adds nothing there and reports
   itself as such.

A key that does not apply to this tracker reports `not applicable` and counts as yielding nothing.

### The stop

**Zero or several hits at every key is a stop.** Name the branch, say what each key found, and ask
the developer which ticket and pull request this run is for:

```
prove-branch cannot resolve the run for branch `<branch>`.
  open pull requests on this branch: <none | #12 | #12, #15>
  key 1 (PRD: #<n> in the PR body): <none | not applicable | #40, #41>
  key 2 ([SPEC] ArtifactLink): <none | not applicable | …>
  key 3 ((#N) commit suffix): <none | #227, #228>
  key 4 (ticket-source key): <none | not applicable | ABC-12, ABC-14>
Which ticket and pull request should this pass prove?
```

The developer's answer resolves the run; record that it came from the developer, not a key.

A key that resolves the ticket while the branch has **no open pull request, or several**, is also a
stop: name the branch, the ticket and the pull requests found, and ask. A pass with no pull request
has no preview deployment to run against.

### Say what was picked

**Before anything else**, state the ticket and the pull request picked: the ticket (its key and
title), the key that resolved it, and the pull request (number or id, head branch, title).

## Session hygiene: check and report, stop on anything unexpected

Before reading the target, confirm and say what you found:

- the pull request's head branch is the one checked out (`git branch --show-current`);
- the pull request is open — `github`: `gh pr view <n> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json state,isDraft,headRefOid`; `azure-devops`: the pull request's status from `mcp__ado__repo_pull_request`;
- the tree is clean (`git status --short`);
- the pull request's head commit is `HEAD` (`git rev-parse HEAD`) — a local commit that is not
  pushed is a commit the preview cannot have built.

Anything unexpected — a dirty tree, a detached `HEAD`, a closed or completed pull request, the
wrong branch, unpushed commits — **say so and stop for the developer**. The skill runs read-only and
verify commands from the adapter's `## Commands` freely; anything that changes the working tree or
starts a long-lived process it proposes and waits for a yes.

## The target

The pass runs against the pull request's **preview deployment**. **The skill never boots the app.**
A local target happens only when the developer asks for one in this session; the developer starts
it and gives the URL, and the skill uses that URL.

1. **Find the URL** from the adapter's `## QA` → *Preview URL pattern* row:
   - a **pattern**: substitute the pull-request number for `<pr-number>`, and confirm the URL
     answers before using it;
   - **`pr-comment`**: read the pull request's comments — `github`: `gh pr view <n> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json comments`; `azure-devops`: the pull request's threads through the MCP — and take
     the preview URL from the most recent comment that posts one.
2. **Read the commit the preview was built from** — the commit the deployment record, the status
   check or the posting comment names for that preview. Compare it with `HEAD`.
3. **Stop and ask the developer for a URL** when the row is absent, when no URL resolves, when the
   URL does not answer, when the preview was built from a commit other than `HEAD`, or when the
   built-from commit cannot be read at all. Say which of these it is, and give the URL and commit
   you found.

**Record two values now: the target URL and the SHA tested.** The SHA tested is the built-from
commit when it matches `HEAD`. A URL the developer supplies is recorded with the commit the
developer states it serves, marked `developer-stated`. The receipt names both.

## Criteria

Read the ticket through `../_shared/ticket-source.md` — its resolution order (§1), its one reader
per system (§2) and where each system keeps acceptance criteria. The resolving key decides the
system:

- keys 1, 2 and 3 resolve an item the loop filed, which lives on the filing tracker and is read
  from the `Tracker:` line (`../_shared/ticket-source.md` §4);
- key 4 resolves a ticket on the system its key belongs to, read from the `Ticket source:` line.

Where the ticket is a PRD or a `[SPEC]` with children, each landed child's acceptance criteria join
the list, attributed to that child.

**A ticket with no acceptance-criteria list is still valid input.** Infer the criteria from the
description and summary, and label each one `inferred`. An inferred criterion is the skill's
reading of the ticket, never the ticket's own words, and the receipt keeps the label.

**The diff is the authority.** Read it — `github`: `gh pr diff <n> --repo <owner>/<repo>`;
`azure-devops`: `git diff <default-branch>...HEAD`, since the MCP exposes no diff tool. Any planned
`## QA notes` in a child issue was written before the code existed; read it for intent and let the
diff overrule it.

## What a run prints

Once the run, the target and the criteria are resolved, print them and stop:

- the ticket, the key that resolved it, and the pull request;
- the hygiene results;
- the target URL and the SHA tested, with `developer-stated` where it applies;
- the criteria, numbered, each with its source — the ticket, a child, or `inferred`.
